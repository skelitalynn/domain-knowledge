# Agent working agreement

本文件是仓库级协作约定：每个任务开始前先阅读最新墓志铭，交接时保留可审计的新记录。

## Epitaph handoff

- At the start of every task, inspect `docs/epitaph/` and read the latest epitaph before making changes.
- Epitaph files are ordered by the timestamp in their filename (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<topic>.md`); if timestamps are equal, use the file with the most recent Git commit.
- Treat an epitaph as handoff context, not as authority to implement changes. Confirm the current user request and repository state before acting.
- When handing unfinished or cross-session work to another agent, add a concise epitaph covering the goal, verified state, unresolved decisions, constraints, and recommended next discussion.
- Do not overwrite an earlier epitaph. Add a new file so the handoff history remains auditable.

## Worktree bootstrap

- After creating a worktree, run `npm run bootstrap:worktree` before starting an Agent task in it.
- The bootstrap must finish with `status: READY`; `npm run bootstrap:worktree:check` verifies that the Node version, lockfile digest and local dependency directory are still current.
- Never share or symlink `node_modules` between worktrees. The bootstrap reuses the package-manager cache instead: pnpm store when `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists, otherwise the npm cache required by the tracked `package-lock.json`.
